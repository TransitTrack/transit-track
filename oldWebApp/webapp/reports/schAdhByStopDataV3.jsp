<%-- Provides schedule adherence data in JSON format. Provides for
     the specified route the number arrivals/departures that
     are early, number late, number on time, and number total for each
     direction for each stop. 
     Request parameters are:
       a - agency ID
       r - route ID or route short name. 
       dateRange - in format "xx/xx/xx to yy/yy/yy"
       beginDate - date to begin query. For if dateRange not used.
       numDays - number of days can do query. Limited to 31 days. For if dateRange not used.
       beginTime - for optionally specifying time of day for query for each day
       endTime - for optionally specifying time of day for query for each day
       allowableEarlyMinutes - how early vehicle can be and still be OK.  Decimal format OK. 
       allowableLateMinutes - how early vehicle can be and still be OK. Decimal format OK.
